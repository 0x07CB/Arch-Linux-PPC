# Arch Linux PPC

**Translation from German to English, and added notes from me**

Welcome to the Arch Linux PPC Project!
This is an attempt to revive the old ArchPPC project from 2012 by Danimoth and kth5. Note: **This hasn't been updated in years, however I want to preserve it because it may be useful.**

This repo is currently incomplete, and still under construction. Note: **Abandoned since 2017, as far as I can tell.**
Most of it is experimental, and compiled with -O3 and Altivec Support, which unfortunately doesn't always result in stable code under the PowerPC architecture.

The packages and PKGBUILDs are currently being tested with an old Arch Linux installation from 2011. Packages that could be successfully built and that can be implemented will find their place here for the time being. You will soon find an HDD image to test on my mirror. Note: **There's no mirror as far as I can tell, and there's no HDD images.**


Why this effort?

Unfortunately, there's only Debian Sid and Gentoo that are currently active and supported PowerPC ports for Macintosh and similar computers, both of which are quite outdated or buggy. Note: **Debian 8 was the last release to support PPC32** I want to remedy this. Note: **This isn't quite true anymore, Gentoo is one of the most up to date distros for PPC but there's also Void Linux, and Debian Sid is PPC64el only while Gentoo works on all PPC architectures to my knowledge.**
